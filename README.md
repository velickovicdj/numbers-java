# 1st Project (Java) - Programming I

**Author: Veličković Đorđe**

## Description

- The program reads an arbitrary input (array) of numbers (integers), analyzes, and performs numerical operations on these numbers. Most of these operations by definition require 2 or more numbers to work.

- Methods are written in descending order.

- Some methods may have return statements of type String because some operations may result in different type values, but nevertheless those values remain unchanged since there is no real difference between printing a number or printing a String in a console.
